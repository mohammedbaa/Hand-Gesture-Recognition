🔍 Exploring Data: I delved into a diverse dataset consisting of 5 different hand gestures performed by 10 subjects. Understanding the structure of the database and visualizing the images helped lay the groundwork.

📊 Data Preprocessing: I tackled tasks like image loading, resizing, and grayscale conversion using OpenCV. Additionally, I ensured data consistency by checking image sizes and shuffled the dataset for better training.

💡 Feature Selection: Transforming the dataset into trainable features and labels, I utilized NumPy arrays for efficient data handling and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

🧠 Modeling: Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, I built a multi-layer neural network for classification. With layers like Flatten, Dense, and LeakyReLU, I constructed a model capable of recognizing hand gestures accurately.

📈 Evaluation & Metrics: After training the model, I evaluated its performance using metrics like loss, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, gaining insights into its effectiveness.

🔮 Future Steps: Excited about the potential applications of gesture recognition technology, I'm eager to explore further enhancements like real-time detection and expanding the gesture vocabulary.
